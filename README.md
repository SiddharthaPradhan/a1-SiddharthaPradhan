This project is a simple website that displays my information and some of my technical skills. I did not use any external libraries, just plain old JS, HTML and CSS.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for:
    - body (light and dark background, font)
    - p (text colors) using a class selector
    - h1/h2/h3 (text color) using a class selector
    - table (alignment and border) using a class selector
    - image (size) using a class selector
    - HTML5 canvas (size and border) using an ID selector
    - flex-container (alignment) using a class selector
I learned to combine different classes to get a user-friendly UI, ex: light mode/ dark mode toggle, with each important HTML element being part of a dark-theme or light theme class.

- **Java Script Animation**: Added a changing looping animation that were made using pure js (no external libs). Animations included:
    - color changing sinwave
    - an expanding bubble animation 
    - a black fade out animation. 
This was particularly challenging as I had not worked with async functions before, and animations in the canvas took a lot of customizing/trial-and-error to appear smooth
    

- **Aditional HTML Tags**:

## Design Achievements
- **Color Palette**: Utilized color palette using color.adobe.com to add more flair to the text.

- **Used the Share Tech Mono Font from Google Fonts**: I used Share Tech Mono as the font for the primary text in my site, using monospace as a backup.
